    <h1>Future plans</h1>

    <h2>Current status</h2>

    <p>
        Right now Bodypace is a diet mobile app, we are going towards implementing everything listed below. Next releases will include basic monitoring of
        sleep, drugs, and exercise, along with storing and sharing of your medical PDF documents.
    </p>

    <p class="note warning">
        disclaimer: This is a hobby project, developed by one person and not usable right now. Use other solutions and visit actual healthcare professionals
        instead of relying on this app. This project is not backed by strong technical or medical team.
    </p>

    <p class="note warning">
        disclaimer 2: Solution described below may already exist. Don't stop looking for such product just because Bodypace is not there yet.
    </p>

    <h2>Idea</h2>

    <h3>Open and privacy respecting platform for your health:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Data</b> : <i>Gathering</i>, <i>Storing</i>, <i>Managing</i>, <i>Sharing</i><br />(Entered manually or via variuos integrations)</li>
        <li>
            <b>Assesments</b> : <b>Current and incomming problems</b>, <b>Your potential</b>, <b>Progress metrics</b><br />(Extracted from data)
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Plans</b> : <i>Fixing problems</i>, <i>Dodging incomming problems</i>, <i>Reaching your potential</i><br />(Treatments & improvements based on
            assesments):
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Costs</b> : <i>Money</i>, <i>Time</i>, <i>Effort</i><br />(Of everything above, with summaries, comparisons, optimizations, and more)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Goals</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Personalize your healthcare</b></li>
        <li><b>Improve your well-being (your body's "pace")</b></li>
        <li>
            <b>Upgrade your "being healthy" standard from "good enough" to "thriving"</b><br /><br />
            (Opt-in for a health system which is build for heavly targeting your more personal metrics, such as your mood, energy, sleep, posture, strength, memory,
            concentration, endurance, appearance, life expectancy, etc. )
        </li>
        <li><b>Provide excellent profilactive system to minimize reactive treatments</b></li>
        <li>
            <b>Provide latest medical knowledge to users in real time</b><br /><br />
            (Create a situation of time working in your favor. Reduce time spent on wondering, being misinformed or unaware of something, fixing some preventable
            mistakes and doing something unknowengly harmful)
        </li>
        <li><b>Make overwhelming stuff organize and present itself to you in simple precise form</b></li>
        <li>
            <b>Do not parent adults, don't be "patient centric", be user centric.</b><br /><br />Provide users with explanations of everything Bodypace
            recommends or does on every demand. Let users own their data. Maximize control and oversight that users have over their health.
        </li>
        <li>
            Handle as much data as possible in as secure as possible manner inside as clear and intuitive UI as possible with as convenient and automated usage
            as possible.
        </li>
        <li>Lay down the fundaments for future AI Doctor and along with robotics major healthcare automation and costs reduction.</li>
        <li><b>Decrease money, time and effort required to achieve above</b></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Believes</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            With time technology will be increasingly more integrated with our daily lives, collecting more data about us, which will also get more personal. We
            need an open and trustworhy system which will store all of that data and process it.
        </li>
        <li>Medicine should not be a pay to win game where common people get basic treatments while rich have personal doctors optimizing them up.</li>
        <li>
            Medicine should not have hidden premium solutions only for people who can afford them or have excessive amounts of time to find them. Access to
            information about what is possible should be as open, convenient and honest (affordability) as possible
        </li>
        <li>Medicine should not be politically correct, it should be biologically correct.</li>
        <li>
            Healthcare should push for automation, especially in the future where decades of training are required to obtain all necessary knowledge and skills
            to provide best health services. Technology evolves way faster than humans and all assumtions of impossible automation are probably naive.
        </li>
        <li>
            Treatments should deeply care about origins of current negative conditions. If those exist, assume they had to exist, and there are reasons why.
            Understand those and be open about your findings.
        </li>
        <li>
            When there is no clear understanding of what is better or worse, provide people with more options they can select from for themselves rather than
            force them to only one which is opinionated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transhumanism is the ultimate goal of advancing medicine, Idealistic efforts that try to slow it down with claims that it's bad (e.g. unethical) are
            probably only wasting time. Humans should be able to change phenotypes like gloves, controversial topics like "designer babies" are nothing compared
            to it and a natural progression.
        </li>
        <li>Healthcare business is special, products which could be cheap probably should be.</li>
    </ul>
